[Description]A tale of dragons and revenge!

[start]
[Text]You find yourself running through a forest. When suddenly a dragon
 appears! Wow, a boss battle this early? What dost thou do?
*RUN*[1] *RIDE THE DRAGON!*[ride] *FIGHT!*[battle] *NOTHING*[]

[1]
[Text]C'mon, don't be a chump...
*OKAY...*[start] **[] **[] **[]

[ride]
[Text]But it's pointy! Ouch....
*GO BACK*[start] **[] **[] **[]

[battle]
[Text]Dragon HP: 100/100. The dragon wonders why we have to fight
 and can't all get along.
*SCREW THAT. USE SWORD*[battle1] *BLOCK*[battle1.1] *PONDER*[] *AGREE TO DISAGREE*[battleend1]

[battle1]
[Text]Dragon HP: 75/100. You jump as high as you can. The training at the
 medieval combat academy is really paying off. You perform a sick spinning sword
 attack that deals 25 damage. As you land the dragon swings his tail at you!
*ROLL OUTTA THERE*[battle2] *TAKE IT LIKE A MAN*[battle1dead] **[] **[]

[battle1.1]
[Text]It doesn't look like block will do much. You've got to be quick and
 aggressive to win this fight!
*USE SWORD*[battle1] **[] **[] **[]

[battle2]
[Text]Dragon HP: 75/100. Zip, zop! You roll with the quickness and just manage
 to evade the dragon's fury. The dragon is off balance! Now is your time to
 strike back.
*DON'T STRIKE BACK*[battle3.1] *STRIKE BACK*[battle3] *BLOCK*[battle1.1] *DO NOTHING*[]

[battle1dead]
[Text]Well, uh, apparantly you are not as manly as you originally thought.
 The dragon hits you right in the face with his spikey tail. You announce that
 "That really hurt!" and run away crying. Embarrassing...
*TRY THAT ONE AGAIN*[battle1] **[] **[] **[]

[battle3.1]
[Text]Way to squander that great oppotunity to strike back. Now you're not sure
 what to do. What do you do?
*NOT SURE*[] *FINE, STRIKE BACK*[battle3] **[] **[]

[battle3]
[Text]Dragon HP: 1/100. Monster critical hit! The dragon is nearly dead and is
 just sitting there, helpless.
*HELP THE POOR CHAP OUT*[battleend] *KILL 'EM!*[battle3.2] **[] **[]

[battle3.2]
[Text]Well, that wouldn't be very nice now would it?
*YEAH FINE, HELP HIM OUT*[battleend] **[] **[] **[]

[battleend1]
[Text]You and the dragon agree to set aside your differences and work together.
 Seems like a nice creature. The dragon asks, "So, what are you doing here anyway?"
*"I could ask you the same."*[dialog1] *"I'm running away from town, you"*[dialog2]
 **[] **[]

[battleend]
[Text]The dragon is forever grateful for sparing its life. The dragon asks,
 "So, what are you doing here anyway?"
*"I could ask you the same."*[dialog1] *"I'm running away from town, you"*[dialog1]
**[] **[]

[dialog1]
[Text]He replies, "Well I was just flying around, minding my own business,
 right? So then some hunters start shooting fire arrows at me." You suspect
 you know who the hunters are, but keep that to yourself for now. He continues,
 "Apparantly my hide is worth a lot or something. Darn ladies have to have their
 dragon-leather purses and such. But anyway enough about me, how about your 
 story?"
*TELL YOUR STORY*[dialog2] **[] **[] **[]

[dialog2]
[Text]You begin, "It all started when I was sitting in my peaceful town of
 Peasantown just a few months ago. We were a simple folk with not much to offer
 but a good home and good food. But then suddenly the town was overrun by a
 group of crazed individuals. They overthrew our government and forced everyone
 to work for them. Most people in the village had no fight in them. They blindy
 accepted their new leaders. This included my parents. I, however, hated the new
 leadership. It was all work and no play anymore. It was like they enslaved the
 whole town, but I weas completely against it. But my parents disowned me,
 so I ran away and decided to never return to that place."
*Continue*[dialog3] **[] **[] **[]

[dialog3]
[Text]"Oh also, I think I may know who has been hunting dragons in these parts."
 you add. The dragon is intrigued. "Oh really?" he asks. You tell him that the
 poachers worked for the new government and you were against their ways, because
 you don't think dragons should be killed like that for no reason. "Alright,
 let's go get revenge on those poachers and purge the town of your new fascist
 government!", the dragon suggests.
*"Well, I dont know.."*[dialog3.1] *LET'S DO IT, KICK BUTT AND TAKE NAMES*[revenge] **[] **[]

[dialog3.1]
[Text]The dragon pleads, "Oh pleasee. I really wanna burn down some evil people
 today!" 
*ALRIGHT FIRE! YEAH SURE, LET'S DO IT*[] **[] **[] **[]

[revenge]
[Text]You hop on the dragon. He shows you how to mount him while avoid his scary
 spikes. You are now riding a dragon to go save your village and destroy the
 evil people! You feel like a boss at this moment. After a short journey you
 arrive at the evil government headquarters.
*NO SURVIVORS. BURN IT DOWN*[burn] *DISCUSS MATTERS WITH CIVILITY*[discuss] **[] **[]

[burn]
[Text]You and dragon begin taking revenge against the evil peoples. The dragon's
 fire scorches everything in sight. Thankfully, there's no one around that you
 care about such as your family. So only the bad people are burning. MWAHAHAHA!
*CONTINUE*[finale] **[] **[] **[]

[discuss]
[Text]Well before you could even approach diplomatically, the poachers come out
 and begin firing at the dragon with greed in their eyes. Now they've pissed
 you off.
*KILL 'EM ALL*[burn] **[] **[] **[]

[finale]
[Text]After you finish off the last of the evil oppressors, you return to your home
 to see how everyone is doing. It appears that the government had cast some sort
 of spell on the village that allowed them to take complete control. You were
 somehow immune to the spell, of course. Your family and the whole village thank
 you and the dragon for your work. Now Peasantown is back to normal, plus you
 have this awesome dragon to protect you from further attacks! Yay!
*Phew, is that it?*[end] **[] **[] *DO NOT CLICK*[secret]

[secret]
[Text]Woah you sure are a rebel aren't you? Watch out for this guy he ignored
 text on a button, wow.
*I GET IT, GO BACK*[finale] **[] **[] **[]

[end]
[Text]Thanks for playing, I hope it was bearable!
