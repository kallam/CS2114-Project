==============

This is the final group project for VT's Fall 2012 offering of CS 2114.

It is an Android application/game that allows a specially formatted text
file to be loaded in order to play a text-based 'choose your own adventure'
style game. It includes a library view of the currently available stories,
but does not currently allow a user to load a file not already included
in the apk.

It is written partially with a custom library (Sofia) of UI widgets and
other code provided by the professor. The included library is outdated 
and was very much a work in progress at the time, but allows standard
Android UI elements to be used in conjuction. Per project requirements, it
targets Froyo (2.2) but should work on most Android devices.
